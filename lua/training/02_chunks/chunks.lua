-- Use of semi-colon -> Not necessary to use , in the category of if you wanna use it then use, but must use in case different statement code written in same line

a = 1 -- fine
b = 2  

a = 1 ; -- Also fine 
b = 2 ;

a = 1 ; b = 3 -- Must use colon

a = 1  b = 3 -- Also fine but hey it does not look good
