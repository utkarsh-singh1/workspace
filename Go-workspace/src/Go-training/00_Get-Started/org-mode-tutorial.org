* Org Basic

- Some important keybinding.

- Hit <Ctrl+enter> on any heading to create similar indentation/star level heading on next phase/under the existing one but hitting <Alt+enter> will create new similiar
  indentation/star level just next line of the heading

- Hit <Alt+arrow-keys> to move up a heading above the similiar level(Star) heading but it can not past its super level heading (like 5* can not go above 4*), but it can be done with the help of <Alt+shift+arrow-keys>.

- Press <C-c C-l> or <M-x org-insert-link Return> to insert a link to a certain text or create a certain text for the link. Ex.[[https:orgmode.org][Org Mode Homepage]]
  
** Important formatting tips

Here some more content

- Also use / around a word/sentence/text to convert it into /italian/ format. 

- Add * around a text/word/sentence to make it *bold*.

- Add _ around text/word/sentence to create a _underline_.

- Use + around text/sentence/word to have a +strikethrough+.

- Use ~ around any single code/script/command to give it ~code~ feel.

- Use = around any  text/sentence/word to have a =verbatim=. 

- You can _/*combine*/_ the basic markup in any order, however ~code~ and =verbatim= need to be the *_~inner-most~_* markers if they are present since their contents
  are interpreted =_literally_=.
  
*** Table in org-mode ( Seriously its fun man)

Added more content

1. table in Emacs - Just create headings i have created here , then press tab at the end word of your last heading, new cells will start to form automatically,
   similiar will happen to the contents to the cells.

   |------------+-----+--------------------|
   | Name       | Age | Does it work (y/n) |
   |------------+-----+--------------------|
   | Ajay Kumar |  90 | y                  |
   | Utkarsh    |  78 | n                  |
   | Somu       |  79 | y                  |
   |            |     |                    |
   |            |     |                    |
   |------------+-----+--------------------|
   |            |     |                    |
   |------------+-----+--------------------|
   

2. Example - try pressing at the end of hello means , press <tab> after o.

   | name   | y/n | hello/bolo |
   | bulaya | n   | hello      |

3. Also pressing <tab> after the end of any word, it will automatically restructure the content according to the size of table, try add a name in the name cell that is
   larger in size than name.

   | name  | does it | where |
   |-------+---------+-------|
   | hello |         | yes   |
   |-------+---------+-------|
   |-------+---------+-------|
   | hello |         | no;   |
   |       |         | kola  |
   |       |         |       |

4. To create a table with borders above the headings, type | then add - in front of it Eg -> '|-', then press tab , it will automatically create a borderline acc. to the table.

   |-------+----+--------|
   | Sytem | Om | HariOm |
   |       |    |        |

***** Writing code in emacs man (maja hi gya [[./melting-emoji.png]] )

One of the best feature of emacs, to write source code in a bloack like this -

Syntax format -

(#+begin_src <language_type/mode>

  <source_code>

 #+end_src)


Ex.

#+begin_src python

  print("Hello World")

#+end_src

#+begin_src go
      package main
      import "fmt"

      func main(){
	  fmt.Println("Hello World")
      }
#+end_src

****** DONE Todo-Done

- use TODO to create task to done. Emacs org-mode has 2 states TODO and DONE , if you wanna change an state to another use <C-c C-t> / <M-x org-todo Return>

- Also use <shift+left/right arrow-keys> to change state of an heading from todo->done->nothing.
  

* Org-Advance

** Org-Agenda

*** Active

**** Kuch toh krna h

**** Kuch toh jaruru krna h 
Now what is deadline - to do some work before a certain date and time. Also emacs (org-agenda) will alarm you about your deadline. You can set the how much days before to alarm you about your task by using ( org-deadline-warning-days) variable in emacs to amount of days you want (default is 14).  

*** Set Birthday in Emacs

**** +Hariom Birthday+

*** Additional Tasks states
