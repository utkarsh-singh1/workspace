** #2 -> Concurrency And Parallelism

Concurrency and Parallelism are related but distinct programming concepts.



*** Concurrency

Concurrency refers to a code that is written in concurrent design pattern. This means code has a potential ability to execute multiple tasks simultaneously, also each tasks may run/progress independent of other tasks.

- In Go, concurrency acheived with the help of go-routines, Goroutines are lightweight threads that enable concurrent execution of Go programs. 
- A GO program can create multiple go-routine that run concurrently, each performing a different task. 
- Concurrency and Synchronization in these go-rutine done using channels, which provides a way for go-routines to exchange data and communicate during execution.

  


*** Parallelism

Parallelism refers to a ability of a program to execute multiple tasks simultaneously using multiple cores/CPUs.

- Parellelism is often used to execute programs faster as it will execute multiple parts of program on parallel or different processors. In Go, we can execute multiple go-routines on different processors using go keyword.
