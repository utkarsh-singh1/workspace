* Introduction 

You already know that HTTP methods and status codes play an essential role in REST APIs. It is important to keep to the conventions for HTTP methods and status codes for two reasons. Firstly, if you follow conventions from the developing phase, it will be much easier to avoid bugs in your code and deploy the final project on the production server. Secondly, it makes it easier for other developers to use your APIs. This reading highlights the most important HTTP methods, status codes and API response types that you will use when working on API projects.

* HTTP methods

In the world of REST APIs, one endpoint can perform multiple tasks. It can deliver a resource, create a new resource, update or delete it. The endpoint remains the same while the action varies. When a client invokes an API, how does the API developer know which of the multiple actions should be performed?  This is where HTTP methods come in.   

HTTP methods or request types tell the API endpoint what it should do with the resources. It defines the action. The API developer makes decisions and manipulates resources appropriately based on the HTTP methods in an HTTP request. Here is a list of the most used HTTP methods and which action you should initiate for those calls. 

| HTTP Method | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| GET         | Returns the requested resource. If not found, returns a 404 Not Found status code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| POST        | Creates a record. The POST request always comes with an HTTP request body containing JSON or Form URL encoded data, which is also called a payload. If the data is valid, the API endpoint will create a new resource based on these data. Although you can create multiple resources with a single POST call, it is not considered a best practice to do so. |
|             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

* Example calls

HTTP method

Sample endpoints

Query string / payload

GET

/api/menu-items

/api/meu-items/1

/api/menu-items?category=appetizers

/api/menu-items?perpage=3&page=2

A GET call doesnât need a payload. However, GET calls can be accompanied by query string parameters and their values to filter the API output.

POST

/api/menu-items

/api/orders

Hereâs a sample JSON payload for the /api/menu-items endpoint to create a new resource:

{

  "title":"Beef Steak",

  "price": 5.50,

  "category":"main",

}

PUT

/api/menu-items/1

/api/orders/1

 

 

Here's a sample JSON payload for this endpoint /api/menu-items/1 to completely replace it. Note that you need to supply all data for a PUT request.

{

  "title":"Chicken Steak",

  "price": 2.50,

  "category":"main",

}

PATCH

/api/menu-items/1

/api/orders/1

Hereâs a sample JSON payload for this endpoint /api/menu-items/1 to partially update this resource

{

   "price": 3.00

}

DELETE

/api/menu-items

/api/menu-items/1

/api/orders

/api/orders/1

When the DELETE call is sent to a collection endpoint, like /api/menu-items the API developer should delete the entire collection. When it is sent to a particular resource, like this, /api/menu-items/1, then the API developer should delete only that resource.  

* Status codes

Sending appropriate status codes with every API response is essential. And as a developer, you should not just pick any code. Every status code has meaning, so you should choose the most appropriate one based on the situation. Hereâs a list of the status code ranges and their purposes. 

Status code range

Purpose

100-199

This range is mainly used to pass on some information. For example, sometimes an API needs time to process the request and it canât instantly deliver the result. In such a case, the API developer can set it to keep returning 102 â Processing until the result is ready. This way, the client understands that the result isnât ready and should be checked again.

200-299

These are the success codes. If the client requests something and the API acts successfully, it should deliver the output with one of these status codes.  

For example, for a  PUT, PATCH, or DELETE call, you can return 200 â Successful if the operation was successful. For a successful POST call, you can set it to return a 201 â Created status code when the resource has been created successfully.  

300-399

These are the redirection codes. Suppose as an API developer, you changed the API endpoint from /api/items to api/menu-items. If the client makes an API call to /api/items, then you can redirect the client to this new endpoint /api/menu-items with a 301 â Permanently moved status code so that the client can make new calls to that endpoint next time.  

400-499

4xx status codes are used in the following situation: if the client requests something that does not exist, sends an invalid payload with insufficient data, or wants to perform an action that the client is not authorized for.

For the above scenarios, the appropriate status codes will be:

Â·       404 - Not Found if the client requests something that doesnât exist,

Â·       400 - Bad Request if a client sends an invalid payload with insufficient data,

Â·       401 - Unauthorized,

Â·       403 - Forbidden if the client tries to perform an action it's not authorized for.

500-599 

These alarming status codes are usually automatically generated on the server side if something goes wrong in the code, and the API developer doesn't write code to deal with those errors. For example, a client requests a non-existing resource, and the API developer tries to display that resource without adequately checking if that resource exists in the database. Or if the API developer didn't validate the incoming data and attempted to create a new resource with invalid or insufficient data. You, as an API developer, should always avoid 5xx errors.  

Response types
These days, the most common response types involved with REST APIs are JSON, XML, plain text, and sometimes YAML. Frameworks like DRF come with built-in renderer classes that can convert the data into an appropriate format and display it correctly.

There are also third-party renderers available for this job. While making an API call, the client can specify its desired response format with the Accept HTTP header. And that header should be considered to deliver the result in that format using the render classes. Hereâs a list of HTTP headers for different response types.  

Response type

Request header

HTML

Accept: text/html

JSON and JSONP
