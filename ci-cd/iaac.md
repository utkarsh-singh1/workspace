* Not just any text file . an textual code (in genral YAML format) that can given to IaC tool so that it can provision your infrastructure element.

* **CMSs ( Software Management System)** made this possible.
* Since textual code is still available, infrastructure can be rapidly created and across different plateforms it can be repeatadly created.
